**CatastRo** provide access to different API services of the [Spanish
Cadastre](https://www.sedecatastro.gob.es/). With **CatastRo** it is possible to
download official information of addresses, properties, parcels and buildings.

## OVCCoordenadas Service

The
[OVCCoordenadas](https://ovc.catastro.meh.es/ovcservweb/OVCSWLocalizacionRC/OVCCoordenadas.asmx)
service allows to retrieve the coordinates of a known cadastral reference
(geocoding). It is also possible to retrieve the cadastral references around a
specific pair of coordinates (reverse geocoding). **CatastRo** returns the
results on a tibble format (see `vignette("tibble", package = "tibble")`). This
functionality is described in detail in the corresponding vignette (see
`vignette("ovcservice")`).

## INSPIRE Services

> The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union spatial data

> spatial information across Europe and assist in policy-making across

The implementation of the INSPIRE directive on the Spanish Cadastre (see
[Catastro INSPIRE](https://www.catastro.minhap.es/webinspire/index.html)) allows
to retrieve spatial objects from the database of the cadastre:

-   **Vector objects:** Parcels, addresses, buildings, cadastral zones and more.
    These objects are provided by **CatastRo** as *sf* objects (see `?sf)`.

-   **Imagery:** Image layers representing the same information than the vector
    objects. These objects are provided by **CatastRo** as *SpatRaster* objects
    (see `?terra)`.

Note that **the coverage of this service is 95% of the Spanish territory**,
excluding Basque Country and Navarre that have their own independent cadastral
offices.

There are three types of functions, each one querying a different service:

1.  **ATOM service**: The ATOM service allows to batch-download vector objects
    of different cadastral elements for a specific municipality.

2.  **WFS service**: The WFS service allows to download vector objects of
    specific cadastral elements.Note that there are some *restrictions on the
    extension and number of elements* to query. For batch-downloading the ATOM
    service is preferred.

3.  **WMS service**: This service allows to download georeferenced images of
    different cadastral elements.

## Examples

### Working with layers

On this example we would demonstrate some of the main capabilities of the
package by recreating a cadastral map of the surroundings of the [Santiago
Bernab√©u Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab%C3%A9u_Stadium).
We would make use of the **WMS and WFS services** to get different layers in
order to show some of the capabilities of the package:
